# WordGame
implemented by MVVM

### Scenario

The task is to write a small language game. The player will see a word in language "one“ on the screen. While
this word is displayed, a word in language "two“ will fall down on the screen. The player will have to choose if
the falling word is the correct translation or a wrong translation. The player needs to answer, before the word
reaches the bottom of the screen. Include a counter that gives the player feedback.

#### Room for creativity
It is up to the applicant to implement how the player chooses correct or wrong. Also when or if a game ends.
In what way correct/wrong/no answer is counted can also be freely chosen, but there must be some visual
feedback.
